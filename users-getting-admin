to solve this, open a powershell with administrator pivileges on windows 10 or 11.

in the folder c:\windows\system32\config path, fire up the command: icacls *.* /inheritance:e
now users can't hack the admins accounts anymore. thats't it! :)

ps: don't forget to delete restoration points to don't travel back in time without the config.
